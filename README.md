# PySpark Regression Project
In this project, a regression model will be created using PySpark with the Spark ML library to predict housing prices using the 'California Housing Prices' dataset.

## Steps to be taken sequentially:
1. Loading the dataset.
2. Exploring the dataset using Spark functions.
3. Selecting features to prepare the data for machine learning.
4. Creating a machine learning model with Spark ML.
5. Measuring the performance of the trained model.

## Target(Label) Feature:
"median_house_value"
